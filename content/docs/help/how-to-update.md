#### To begin, head to the LChat call page.

##### **Once there, under the text, enter your desired meeting name.**

\*A quick note here: Make your meeting name unique enough that it will not already be in use (think "ournewmushroomshow" instead of "mushrooms"). \*

Then click "Go."

However, there is one super important detail you must still do: add a password to the call. This is a straightforward step, and prevents unwanted zoombombers from crashing your call. To add a password — right after you've started the call — click the "shield" icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. 

Select "add password," and then enter your desired password in the blank field (please do not use "password" as your password). Press enter, and your Jitsi call is now password protected.
