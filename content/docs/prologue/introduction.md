# L Chat&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;

One page summary of how to start a new Doks project.

## Specifications

Initial connections are normally p2p, with Lunar Chat we can ensure Hop 2 Hop, meaning that when you connect to a call, you do not connect to that user but instead the server which hosts Lunar chat. Or in the case of purchasing a custom license, your own server instance, or even local server. L chat can be setup on a local network, or deployed to the cloud and accessible globally. Hop 2 hop ensures that, only the security of the server/host, and those maintaining it are in question regards to who may view calls and potential info. By enabling End to End encryption, even if the host server or local network were to be compromised, any information pertaining calls would be undecipherable.

## Security

All meeting rooms are ephemeral: they only exist while the meeting is actually taking place.

In the case of \*\*multiparty meetings, all audio and video traffic is still encrypted on the network (again, using DTLS-SRTP). Packets are decrypted while traversing Jitsi Videobridge; \*\*however, they are never stored in any persistent storage and only live in memory while being routed to othe participants in the meeting.

## Technical Limits

###### 256 concurrent connection. Unlike Zoom it is possible to manage 256 video and audio guests to a conference. There will however be technical limits on the individual users hardware. For services where interaction of all participants is necessary, we can configure this as a custom solution to hand 1000 users to occupy the same room. If it is then desired to share the conference to viewers who have no audio or video input. We can configure this with modern day streaming providers to stream to more than 100 million users at one time.

## Test Results - Security

*Best in class for security, British based, secure technology, more secure than competitors*

***The Most secure way to operate our service is too disable streaming and recording, this is done by default on public access Lchat.co.uk then selecting in the settings ‘Enable End to End encryption’***

## Comparison with zoom

Zoom currently offer no means of End to End encryption. **- *it might be considered military grade, but we believe security is important***

Available on your own secure server unlike zoom

No 40 min call limit unlike zoom
