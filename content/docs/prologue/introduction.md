One page summary of how to start a new Doks project.

## Specifications

Initial connections are normally p2p, with Lunar Chat we can ensure Hop 2 Hop, meaning that when you connect to a call, you do not connect to that user but instead the server which hosts Lunar chat. Or in the case of purchasing a custom license, your own server instance, or even local server. L chat can be setup on a local network, or deployed to the cloud and accessible globally. Hop 2 hop ensures that, only the security of the server/host, and those maintaining it are in question regards to who may view calls and potential info. By enabling End to End encryption, even if the host server or local network were to be compromised, any information pertaining calls would be undecipherable.

## Feature Outline

## Security

All meeting rooms are ephemeral: they only exist while the meeting is actually taking place.

In the case of \*\*multiparty meetings, all audio and video traffic is still encrypted on the network (again, using DTLS-SRTP). Packets are decrypted while traversing Jitsi Videobridge; \*\*however, they are never stored in any persistent storage and only live in memory while being routed to othe participants in the meeting.

## Technical Limits

###### 256 concurrent connection. Unlike Zoom it is possible to manage 256 video and audio guests to a conference. There will however be technical limits on the individual users hardware. For services where interaction of all participants is necessary, we can configure this as a custom solution to hand 1000 users to occupy the same room. If it is then desired to share the conference to viewers who have no audio or video input. We can configure this with modern day streaming providers to stream to more than 100 million users at one time.

## Test Results - Security

*Best in class for security, British based, secure technology, more secure than competitors*

***The Most secure way to operate our service is too disable streaming and recording, this is done by default on public access Lchat.co.uk then selecting in the settings ‘Enable End to End encryption’***

## Comparison with zoom

Zoom currently offer no means of End to End encryption. **- *it might be considered military grade, but we believe security is important***

Available on your own secure server unlike zoom

No 40 min call limit unlike zoom

British unlike zoom

# How to Start a Call[← OnDevs](https://preview--doks-1-6dc49.stackbit.dev/docs/prologue/commands/)&#xA;&#xA;

Starting a call couldn't be easier.

#### To begin, head to the LChat call page.

##### **Once there, under the text, enter your desired meeting name.**

\*A quick note here: Make your meeting name unique enough that it will not already be in use (think “ournewmushroomshow” instead of “mushrooms”). \*

Then click “Go.”

However, there is one super important detail you must still do: add a password to the call. This is a straightforward step, and prevents unwanted zoombombers from crashing your call. To add a password — right after you’ve started the call — click the “shield” icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Select “add password,” and then enter your desired password in the blank field (please do not use “password” as your password). Press enter, and your l Chat call is now password protected.

Because a video call isn’t a video call without other participants, you need to invite them to join you. L Chat makes this process as easy as sending your friends the meeting URL.

So, in the case of the above example, you would send your friends lchat.co.uk/ournewmushroomshow

Offering a host of features that compete directly with paid video-conferencing tools. For starters, you can screen share, record meetings, and switch to tile view.

Blur Background

L Chat lets you automatically blur your background. This is a neat tool that comes in handy for everything from hiding the fact that you didn’t clean your room from your mom to obscuring details of your apartment to strangers. *Please not this is still in an experimental phase and does not support mobile use*

To enable the blur, select the three vertical dots in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Next, select “blur my background.”

Raise your hand

If you click the hand icon in the bottom-left corner, other call participants will see a tiny hand icon pop up in the upper-left corner of your video. That way, your fellow callers will know that you have something important to say.

Perhaps you want share a thought with everyone, but don’t want to interrupt to conversation. That’s where the chat box comes in. Just to the right of the hand icon, the chat icon opens up a text-based chat box. Chose a name for yourself, type in your message, and hit enter. That’s all.

Tile view

To switch the call to tile view, once the call has started click the four little boxes in the bottom-right corner. To switch back, click it again.

We were fortunate enough to help by answering the call of duty and offering a free video conferencing platform anyone could use: lchat.co.uk We are hardly alone in this one. Other companies such as Mattermost and their messaging collaboration tools are essential for any form of productive remote work. OnDevs
