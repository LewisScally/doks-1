  free video conferencing platform anyone could use: lchat.co.uk We are hardly
  alone in this one. Other companies such as Mattermost and their messaging
  collaboration tools are essential for any form of productive remote work.

## Testimonials

Some feedback from a some of our many happy customers

> A sole trader, based in a metropolitan American city. A population consisting of wealthy elite. Those either unable, or unwilling to service their own homes. Big homes. Converting each day that we resume the campaigns for as little as $3 per lead in an industry where the average click is $15. The revenue from one sale exceeded $500 with 80% profit. This enabled the sole trader to set up practice in America, open a small store, buy more equipment, purchase two branded vehicles and hire three new employees.

> **HEPA Duct Servicing**

> We ran a promotion before the winter holidays, offering a free teeth whitening to the established target demographic, increasing patient signups with the use of the treatment. Any subsequent visits and treatments were additional business revenue. In a short month we produced 15 new patients. A monumental achievement, and with average dental patient lifetime billings being around £46,000. A potential £690,000 lifetime value was created in just a month.
