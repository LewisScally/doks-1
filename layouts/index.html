        <p>Some of the people watching our repos have been asking us what the deal was with this little new HIPS project (which by the way stands for Hidden In Plain Sight). Well, now you know! HIPS is about using a new Chrome WebRTC API called “Insertable Streams” to add a second layer of end-to-end encryption to media streams in a way that would make them inaccessible to the video router.

        <p>2020 will go in the history books as a really unusual year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic millions of people had to stay home and continue working. This situation put companies, families, schools and many more through a very rough test. People had to change the way they worked.

We were fortunate enough to help by answering the call of duty and offering a free video conferencing platform anyone could use: lchat.co.uk We are hardly alone in this one. Other companies such as Mattermost and their messaging collaboration tools are essential for any form of productive remote work.</p>
